        <dt>Project Description</dt>
        <dd>With the rapid development of the global maritime transportation industry, the number and density of 
ship transportation at sea have been increasing, and the accompanying problems brought by ships to 
the environment have become more and more complicated, while the probability of serious maritime 
accidents and major oil spill pollution risks has also increased significantly. The number of shipwrecks in 
the world with potential pollution risk is 8596, including 1583 oil tankers and 6986 non-oil tankers, the 
total amount of oil not leaked and residual in these shipwrecks has reached 2.5 million tons ~ 20.4 
million tons, if we do not take timely and effective measures for the rapid recovery of the residual oil 
stored in these shipwrecks, the potential pollution is a serious threat to the safety of the marine 
environment. 

The main task of this project is to address the rapid recovery of oil from shipwrecks, and the topic is 
divided into five parts: identification of the opening point, connection of the opening equipment, 
electronic control and automation equipment, robotic arm action planning, analysis, flow field 
simulation, shape design and robotic arm end-effector. 

The significance of this project is to make the recovery of crude oil from sunken ships more convenient, 
fast and safe at sea, which greatly increases the mobility of the ship and the safety of the work of 
recovering oil from sunken ships. At the same time, with the help of robotic arm to operate the drilling 
device and the wreck oil recovery valve docking and disengagement, to reduce the safety of personnel 
to go down to the depths of the sea to work, in order to better realize the rapid and effective recovery 
of the wreck oil treatment laid the foundation.
