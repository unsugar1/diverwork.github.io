        <dt>Third Week Schedule</dt>
        <dd>The group held a meeting at 1:30 p.m. on 6 September, This week we designed the basic structure of the entire equipment, drew a simple diagram of the structure, and discussed the feasibility of the equipment with the tutor.

1. ** Opening Equipment: **

-I choose to use a cylindrical milling cutter according to the characteristics of the oil tank is generally a hollow cuboid, with this tool，we only need to remove a concentric circle shape material when punching, we can get a relatively large hole. 
No further reaming is required to pump oil. According to the specifications of Marine loading and unloading hose provided by Ye Tong Fluid Technology (Beijing) LTD., the outer diameter of the thickest hose is 71.1 mm and the outer diameter of the preliminary design tool is 100 mm to meet the needs of the pipeline to extend into the oil tank.

2. ** Robotic Arm End-effector**

Design parameters and requirements of end-effector.
1. The object to be grasped (geometric parameters and mechanical properties)
2. Material feeder or storage device
3. Robot operation sequence
4. Matching of end-effector and robots
5. Environmental conditions



<dd>
3. **Analysis of motion planning of mechanical arm **

Flexibility and scope of work:High flexibility and range of work. Each joint can perform an independent rotational motion

Reconfigurability: Modular design, so that its structure and function can be freely combined and adjusted according to actual needs

Scalability and upgradability: Different functional requirements can be accomplished by adding accessories or changing tools



<dd>
4. **Analysis of motion planning of mechanical arm **
Establish a basic coordinate system x0y0z0 at the base of the robot, first determine that the z1 axis is the axis of rotation of joint 0, that is, coincide with the z0 axis, and then determine the x1 axis, x1 is the position of joint 1, y1 is determined according to x1, z1 in the direction of the right-handed coordinate system, so that the D-H parameter of joint 1, d1 is the distance between x0 and x1, that is, the z0 direction shifts the height of the base 368mm, and a1 is the distance between z1 and z0, That is, the distance of translation in the direction of x0 is 0, α1 is the angle of rotation around the axis of x0, and θ1 is the variable. 


<dd>
5. **Equipment Automation**
When the gate needs to be opened, the oil is fed into the system through the hydraulic pump and enters the rodless chamber of the hydraulic cylinder. The hydraulic fluid pushes the hydraulic rod to extend outward, and through the unfolding of the connecting rod drives the door leaf to rotate and open, and reaches the specified position.
